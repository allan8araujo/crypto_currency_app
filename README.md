# Crypto currency app

 The application is designed to display a comprehensive list of all cryptocurrencies available, allowing users to track the daily movements and prices of their favorite currencies. This is achieved by making API calls via the CoinAPI platform using Retrofit, and images are loaded using the Coil library.

The app's architecture follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, which allows for clean and efficient code separation, improving code maintainability and readability.

By providing real-time data on preferred cryptocurrencies, the user-friendly and visually appealing interface aims to enhance the user experience.
